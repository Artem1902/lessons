      <h2>Editorial stance</h2>
      <p>
        The editorial pages of The New York Times are typically liberal in their
        position.[151][152] In mid-2004, the newspaper's then public editor
        (ombudsman), Daniel Okrent, wrote that "the Op-Ed page editors do an
        evenhanded job of representing a range of views in the essays from
        outsiders they publish â€“ but you need an awfully heavy counterweight to
        balance a page that also bears the work of seven opinionated columnists,
        only two of whom could be classified as conservative (and, even then, of
        the conservative subspecies that supports legalization of gay unions
        and, in the case of William Safire, opposes some central provisions of
        the Patriot Act)."[153]

      <h3>Style</h3>
      <p>
        Unlike most U.S. daily newspapers, the Times relies on its own in-house
        stylebook rather than The Associated Press Stylebook. When referring to
        people, The New York Times generally uses honorifics rather than
        unadorned last names (except in the sports pages, pop culture
        coverage,[158] and the Book Review and Magazine).[159] The New York
        Times printed a display advertisement on its first page on January 6,
        2009, breaking tradition at the paper.[160] The advertisement, for CBS,
        was in color and ran the entire width of the page.[161] The newspaper
        promised it would place first-page advertisements on only the lower half
        of the page.[160]
