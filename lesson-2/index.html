        <h3>Origins</h3>
        <p>
          <span>The New York Times</span> was founded as the New-York Daily
          Times on September 18, 1851.[a][20]<br />
          <mark>Founded by journalist and politician Henry Jarvis Raymond</mark>
          and former banker George Jones, the Times was initially published by
          Raymond, Jones & Company.[21][22] Early investors in the company
          included
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>Edwin B. Morgan,[23]</li>
          <li>Christopher Morgan,[24]</li>
          <li>Edward B. Wesley.[25]</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          <span>Sold for a penny</span> (equivalent to $0.35 in 2022), the
          inaugural edition attempted to address various speculations on its
          purpose and positions that preceded its release:[26]
        </p>
        <h3>Ochs Ownership</h3>
        <p>
          <span>After George Jones died in 1891</span> , Charles Ransom Miller
          and other New York Times editors
          <mark>raised $1 million</mark> (equivalent to $33 million in 2022) to
          buy the Times, printing it under the New York Times Publishing
          Company.[35][36] <br />The newspaper found itself in a financial
          crisis by the Panic of 1893,[34] and by 1896, the newspaper had a
          circulation of less than 9,000 and was losing $1,000 a day. That year,
          Adolph Ochs, the publisher of the Chattanooga Times, gained a
          controlling interest in the company for $75,000.[37]

        <h3>Early digital content</h3>
        <p>
          The New York Times switched to a digital production process sometime
          before 1980, but only began preserving the resulting digital text that
          year.[61] In 1983, the Times sold the electronic rights to its
          articles to LexisNexis. <br />As the online distribution of news
          increased in the 1990s, the Times decided not to renew the deal and in
          1994 the newspaper regained electronic rights to its articles.[62] On
          January 22, 1996, NYTimes.com began publishing.[63]
        </p>
        <h4>2000s</h4>
        <p>
          In August 2007, the paper reduced the physical size of its print
          edition, cutting the page width from 13.5 inches (34 cm) to a 12
          inches (30 cm). This followed similar moves by a roster of other
          newspapers in the previous ten years, including USA Today, The Wall
          Street Journal, and The Washington Post. The move resulted in a 5%
          reduction in news space, but (in an era of dwindling circulation and
          significant advertising revenue losses) also saved about $12 million a
          year.[64][65]
        </p>
        <h4>2010s</h4>
        <p>
          In December 2012, the Times published "Snow Fall", a six-part article
          about the 2012 Tunnel Creek avalanche which integrated videos, photos,
          and interactive graphics and was hailed as a watershed moment for
          online journalism.[68][69] In 2013, "How Y’all, Youse and You Guys
          Talk," an interactive quiz created by intern Josh Katz,[70] based on
          the Harvard Dialect Survey, which collected responses of more than
          50,000 people answering 122 questions about the way they said
          different things across the United States[71] became the Times most
          popular piece of content of the year.[70]

        <h3>News staff</h3>
        <p>
          In addition to its New York City headquarters, the paper has newsrooms
          in London and Hong Kong.[135][136] Its Paris newsroom, which had been
          the headquarters of the paper's international edition, was closed in
          2016, although the city remains home to a news bureau and an
          advertising office.[137][138] The paper also has an editing and wire
          service center in Gainesville, Florida.[139]
        </p>
        <h3>Ochs-Sulzberger family</h3>
        <p>
          In 1896, Adolph Ochs bought The New York Times, a money-losing
          newspaper, and formed the New York Times Company. The Ochs-Sulzberger
          family, one of the United States' newspaper dynasties, has owned The
          New York Times ever since.[33] The publisher went public on January
          14, 1969, trading at $42 a share on the American Stock Exchange.[146]
          After this, the family continued to exert control through its
          ownership of the vast majority of Class B voting shares. Class A
          shareholders are permitted restrictive voting rights, while Class B
          shareholders are allowed open voting rights.

        <h3>Editorial stance</h3>
        <p>
          The editorial pages of The New York Times are typically liberal in
          their position.[151][152] In mid-2004, the newspaper's then public
          editor (ombudsman), Daniel Okrent, wrote that "the Op-Ed page editors
          do an evenhanded job of representing a range of views in the essays
          from outsiders they publish – but you need an awfully heavy
          counterweight to balance a page that also bears the work of seven
          opinionated columnists, only two of whom could be classified as
          conservative (and, even then, of the conservative subspecies that
          supports legalization of gay unions and, in the case of William
          Safire, opposes some central provisions of the Patriot Act)."[153]
        </p>
        <h4>Style</h4>
        <p>
          Unlike most U.S. daily newspapers, the Times relies on its own
          in-house stylebook rather than The Associated Press Stylebook. When
          referring to people, The New York Times generally uses honorifics
          rather than unadorned last names (except in the sports pages, pop
          culture coverage,[158] and the Book Review and Magazine).[159] The New
          York Times printed a display advertisement on its first page on
          January 6, 2009, breaking tradition at the paper.[160] The
          advertisement, for CBS, was in color and ran the entire width of the
          page.[161] The newspaper promised it would place first-page
          advertisements on only the lower half of the page.[160]
