      <p>In his biography of Alexander Hamilton, Ron Chernow writes that Hamilton “always had to fight the residual
        sadness
        of the driven man.” That sentence has stayed with me because I’ve also noticed that there can be something sad
        about
        extremely ambitious people — like they’re striving furiously to fill a hole that was carved into them by
        traumatic
        experiences during childhood, and they have never quite succeeded.</p>
      <p>Some historians and psychologists have marveled at how many of the most significant figures in history lost a
        parent at an early age, either to death or abandonment — from George Washington and Thomas Jefferson to Bill
        Clinton
        and Barack Obama. These are what one psychologist termed “eminent orphans.”</p>
      <p>It’s easy to put Elon Musk into that category. He had a miserable childhood in South Africa marked by verbal
        and
        physical abuse from a father who repeatedly told him he was worthless, according to Walter Isaacson’s new
        biography
        of Musk. He had no friends and lived in a world in which you either bullied or were bullied. A background like
        that
        might create a sense of existential insecurity, which could induce in some a lifetime of self-doubt or in others
        a
        manic ambition to prove the bastards wrong — to earn love, significance and safety.</p>
