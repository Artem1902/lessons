          The first generation of Ford Escape was released in 2000 for the 2001 model year. It was jointly developed
          with <mark>Mazda</mark>, in which Ford owned a controlling interest, and was released simultaneously with the
          Mazda Tribute. Although the Escape and Tribute shared the same underpinnings constructed from the <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford_CD2_platform" target="_blank" title="Ford CD2 platform">Ford CD2
            platform</a> (based on Mazda GF underpinnings), the only panels common to the two vehicles were the roof and
          floor pressings.<br>Powertrains were supplied by Mazda with respect to the base inline-four engine, with
          <span>Ford providing the optional V6</span>. At first, the twinned models were assembled by Ford in the US for
          North American consumption, with Mazda in Japan supplying cars for other markets. This followed a long history
          of Mazda-derived Fords, starting with the Ford Courier in the 1970s.
        </p>
        <p>
          At the time, larger sport-utility vehicles tended to use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pickup_truck"
            target="_blank" title="Pickup truck-based">pickup truck-based</a>, body-on-frame designs. Other car makers,
          Jeep, Toyota and Honda had been offering smaller unibody designs, the Jeep Cherokee (XJ), RAV4 and CR-V
          respectively. Solid rear axles were commonly used on the full-sized truck-based SUVs and Jeep Cherokee due to
          their ability to carry heavy loads at the expense of a comfortable ride and good handling. Ford and Mazda
          decided to offer a car-like, unibody design with a fully independent suspension and rack and pinion steering
          similar to the RAV4 and CR-V in the Escape.[6] Although not meant for serious off-roading, a full-time
          all-wheel-drive (AWD) system supplied by Dana was optional, which included a locking center differential
          activated by a switch on the dashboard.[7]<br> The AWD system normally sends most of the power from the engine
          to the front wheels. If slipping is detected at the front, more power will be sent to the rear wheels in a
          fraction of a second. The four wheel drive system was a newer version of <span> Ford's "Control Trac" 4x4
            system</span>, dubbed the Control Trac II 4WD in the Escape. This system allowed the front wheels to receive
          100% of the torque until a slip was detected. Using a Rotary Blade Coupling, the rear wheels could be
          <mark>sent up to 100% </mark>of the power in fractions of a second. When switching the system from "Auto" to
          "On," the front and rear axles are locked at a 50/50 split; the reaction time necessary to engage the rear
          wheels is reduced via an integrated bypass clutch. The Control Trac II system allows for a four-wheel drive
          vehicle without the use of a center differential. The entire braking system was built by Continental Teves,
          including the ABS and various related suspension components.[8]

          The second generation Ford Escape debuted at <mark>the 2006 Los Angeles International Auto Show</mark>.[32]
          The North American-market Escape and its Mazda Tribute and Mercury Mariner siblings were redesigned to stay
          competitive with other new compact SUVs, however most of the internals have been carried over for the 2008
          model year.<br> The Escape still uses the CD2 platform.[33] <span>Ford also included an electronic stability
            control system</span> standard on the 2008 Escape.[34] The Mercury version lasted until late 2010, withdrawn
          from the market as part of the closure of the Mercury brand, with Mazda's Tribute ending production in late
          2011. Ford ended manufacture of the second series Escape in 2012. </p>
        <p>
          The updated Escape received some styling cues from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford_Explorer"
            target="_blank" title="Explorer">Explorer</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford_Edge"

            target="_blank" title="Expedition">Expedition</a>. Changes include a new grille with larger headlamps in the
          front fascia, while the sides were revised with cleaner lines and rounder wheel arches. <span>The interior is
            also completely redesigned</span>, including the newest standard Ford family navigation system.[35]<br> The
          2008 Escape and its Mercury Mariner sibling were the first vehicles to feature Ford's pull-drift steering
          mode, an enhancement made possible by applying software control to the Electric Power Steering (EPS)
          system.[36]<br> The 2008 models of all three <mark>CD-2 versions</mark> retained the previous generation's
          engines and transmissions. In 2009, all three versions receceived engine and transmission upgrades that
          increased performance and fuel economy.<br> Ford ended production on the second generation Escape in 2011 and
          moved production to its Louisville Assembly Plant in Louisville, Kentucky, where it was succeeded by a new
          Escape based on its <span>European CUV counterpart</span>, the Ford Kuga.[37]

          <mark>The third-generation</mark> Escape was first shown at the <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LA_Auto_Show#2011" target="_blank" title="Show">2011 Los Angeles Auto
            Show</a>. It was designed and rebadged by Ford of Europe alongside the largely identical European-market
          Ford Kuga.[69][70] It was released to North American markets in 2012 for the 2013 model year.<br>Many markets
          that previously used the "Escape" nameplate have switched to "Kuga" under the One Ford program, apart from the
          Middle East where it still bears the "Escape" nameplate.[71]
        </p>
        <p>
          The third-generation Escape is claimed to be 10 percent more aerodynamic than the previous generation.[72]
          Also <span>new for the 2013 model year</span> is the MyFord Touch entertainment system, which offers an
          all-new user interface and additional features. Another new feature is the optional hands-free liftgate. A
          person carrying the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remote_keyless_system" target="_blank">keyless
            entry</a> transmitter can raise a foot under <span>the rear bumper of the Escape</span> to open the
          tailgate.[73]<br>Ecofriendly seat fabrics are standard on lower trim levels, and the vehicle's carpeting is
          mostly constructed from recycled plastic water bottles. This allows the <mark>new Escape</mark> to be mostly
          recyclable at the end of its lifecycle.

          <mark>The fourth-generation Escape</mark> debuted on April 2, 2019, and went on sale in the third quarter of
          2019 as a 2020 model.<br>It is manufactured at the <a

          in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisville,_Kentucky" target="_blank">Louisville, Kentucky</a>. It

        <p>
          Compared to its predecessor, the model is claimed to be lighter by over 200 pounds (91 kg) while occupying a
          footprint that is larger due to a wider track and longer length.<span> With its larger size</span>, the Escape
          provides more interior space for occupants by increasing headroom, shoulder space, and hip room for both rows
          of seats.<br><mark>Combustion-powered models</mark> are equipped with sliding second-row seats that allows a
          maximum of 37.5 cubic feet (1,062 L) of cargo space.[95]
