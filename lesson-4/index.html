    <p>A redesigned Sorento (codename XM) was launched <mark>in South Korea</mark> in April 2009. The second generation
     was Kia's
     first model to be manufactured in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States" target="_blank">the United
      States</a>, in Kia's new US$1 billion West Point, <span>Georgia,
      factory</span> (which
     also builds the sister vehicle to the Sorento, the Hyundai Santa Fe).<br>The second generation used Kia's corporate
     Tiger Nose grille, and was the first Kia vehicle to offer Kia UVO.[9][10] The vice president of marketing for Kia
     Motors America said that Kia initially considered changing the name due to the radical change in the Sorento's body
     style.[11]</p>
    <p>The second-generation Sorento introduced Kia's new design language, and introduced new features and technology
     that would later <span>become available</span> on other Kia models.</p>
    <p id="p-id">The four-cylinder model returned to the lineup for North American models after being absent between
     2007 and
     2010. The engine was transverse, and the suspension all-independent.<br>The change in body construction as well as
     the
     loss of a low-ratio transfer case made the Sorento 475 pounds less than the old one model for model, to gain in
     performance and economy.</p>
    <p>The second generation Sorento was originally available in four models – the Base, LX, EX and top-of-the-line SX
     models. The SX is only available with the 3.5-liter 276 hp (206 kW) V6. The Base and <span>LX both come
      standard</span> with the
     2.4-liter straight-4 175 hp (130 kW) and EX has the GDI version of the same engine which is rated 191 hp. The V6 is
     available as an upgrade for both the LX and EX. The SX Limited model became available in 2012.</p>

    <p>The Sorento received a mid-cycle refresh for the 2014 model year, unveiled in 2012 at the Los Angeles
     International Auto Show, and went on sale in first quarter of 2013.[12]<br>Major changes included a revised
     instrument
     panel, front and rear end with new tail lights modeled after the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kia_K5#TF"
      target="_blank">Optima</a>, as well as several other mechanical and
     interior changes.</p>
    <p>For 2015, <mark>the six-speed manual transmission option</mark>, previously o<span>nly available on the Base and
      LX</span>
     models, was
     discontinued, leaving the six-speed automatic transmission as the only transmission option for the Sorento.</p>

   <p>As part of 2014 Sorento market launch in the US, a campaign titled "It has an answer for everything" was unveiled
    during <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl_XLVII" target="_blank">Super Bowl XLVII</a>. "Space Babies"
    (directed by Jake Scott) commercial was premiered in the fourth quarter,
    featuring the existence of a faraway planet known as "Babylandia" and follows infant boys, girls, dogs, pandas and
    more on their journey to Earth to join their new families.<br>After taking it all in, the curious child begins to
    offer
    an alternative theory passed on by a friend but his quick-thinking father calls upon UVO's voice-activated jukebox
    feature to hurriedly change the subject and survive another day in the adventures of parenthood. <mark>"Tight
     Space"</mark>
    (directed by Peter Darley Miller and Colin Jeffery) showed two of the CUV's available features – power-folding
    mirrors and power liftgate – help a determined father make the slimmest parking garage space manageable while his
    skeptical wife and children look on.[18][19]</p>
